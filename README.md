# Down-Syndrome-Prediction
Developed a multi-class classifier to report which subset of proteins is important in predicting classes and Predicted the proteins contributing to Down Syndrome based on the insights from the model
# Background
Some experiments were conducted on mice to see if a treatment of Downâ€™s syndrome works or not. Mice were divided into control and diseased (genotype), treated or untreated and whether it shows a particular behavior or not (treatment_behavior). Readings for 77 proteins were recorded for the mice, but some of the readings were discarded if they seemed unreliable (out of range). The goal is to develop a classifier, and also find out which subset of proteins is important in predicting classes.
